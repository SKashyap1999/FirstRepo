ASSIGNMENT-1
ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection

In this assignment, you will use a dataset for predictive learning and check the quality of the data and determine which features are important.

Answer the following questions:

* What are the data types? (Only numeric and categorical)

* Are there missing values?

* What are the likely distributions of the numeric variables?

* Which independent variables are useful to predict a target (dependent variable)? (Use at least three methods)

* Which independent variables have missing data? How much? 

* Do the training and test sets have the same data?

* In the predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?

* Which predictor variables are the most important?

* Do the ranges of the predictor variables make sense?

* What are the distributions of the predictor variables?   

* Remove outliers and keep outliers (does if have an effect of the final predictive model)?

* Remove 1%, 5%, and 10% of your data randomly and impute the values back using at least 3 imputation methods. How well did the methods recover the missing values?  That is remove some data, check the % error on residuals for numeric data and check for bias and variance of the error.

For categorical data, calculate the accuracy and a confusion matrix.

Assignment-5
20 Exam Questions Part A

Create 20, 5-point moderately hard exam questions.  You will be graded on whether your questions are related to the topics listed on the sample exam page, their correctness, and whether or not they are trivial.    To generate using ChatGPT you might try the following:

 

Can you generate a moderately hard multiple answers quiz question related to the choice of kernel size in a CNN?
Sure! Here's a multiple-choice quiz question related to the choice of kernel size in a convolutional neural network (CNN):

Suppose you are designing a CNN for image classification, and you are trying to choose the appropriate kernel size for your convolutional layers. Which of the following statements is true?

A) A smaller kernel size will capture more fine-grained features in the image. B) A larger kernel size will capture more fine-grained features in the image. C) A smaller kernel size will result in a larger receptive field for the output feature map. D) A larger kernel size will result in a larger receptive field for the output feature map.

Explanation:

The choice of kernel size in a CNN determines the size of the local receptive field for each feature map. The receptive field is the portion of the input image that contributes to the output value of a single neuron in the feature map.

A smaller kernel size will capture fewer features in the image, but it will result in a smaller receptive field for the output feature map. This can be useful for capturing fine-grained details in the image, such as edges or small patterns. However, using a smaller kernel size may also result in a loss of information or overfitting if the network becomes too focused on these fine-grained details.

A larger kernel size will capture more features in the image, but it will result in a larger receptive field for the output feature map. This can be useful for capturing larger patterns or structures in the image, but it may also result in a loss of spatial resolution or reduced ability to capture fine-grained details.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) A larger kernel size will result in a larger receptive field for the output feature map.
